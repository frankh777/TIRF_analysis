# TIRF_analysis
My program to improve TIRFM image analysis by increasing peak detection automating trace analysis.

Required MATLAB toolboxes are: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, and Image Processing Toolbox.
Use the Analysis script to load a .tif movie, this will generate several graphs of different analyses such as the distribution of liposome intensities.
